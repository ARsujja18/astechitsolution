# ASTECH IT SOLUTION — Demo Site

This is a simple static website you can upload to a GitHub repository and serve with **GitHub Pages**.

## Quick start
1. Create a new repo on GitHub (public).
2. Upload these files (or drag & drop the whole folder).
3. In the repo: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**: Source = `main` branch.
4. Optional: In **Custom domain**, add your domain and enable **Enforce HTTPS** once available.

## Customize
- Replace `info@yourdomain.com` in `index.html` with your real email.
- Update text in `index.html` and `services.html`.
- The logo is in `assets/img/logo.svg`. Replace with your own if you like.
